# Overview

This project is an extension/recreation of the work done by Mohammad Hussain Al-Rabeah and Amir Lakizadeh to model drug-drug interactions. 

The original code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/Mohammad-Hussain95/GNN_DDI/tree/main)

# Result Replication

Please refer to the [Simplified DDI Model](https://github.com/NealRyan/Drug-drug-interaction-modeling/blob/main/Simplified_DDI_Model) notebook to observe the results of the model recreation. Note that no training occurs in this notebook.

# Model Implementation

Further detail on how the model was refactored into pytorch and trained can be found in the [Notebooks with Training](https://github.com/NealRyan/Drug-drug-interaction-modeling/tree/main/Notebooks%20with%20Training) folder.

# Experimentation / Feature Importance

TBD
