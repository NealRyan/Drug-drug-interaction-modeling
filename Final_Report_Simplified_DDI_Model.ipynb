        "##### Problem Background\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "When multiple drugs are used in treatment of a patient, there is a possibility drugs interact, potentially causing harmful effects.\n",
        "To reduce drug development time and uncover negative interactions before human trials, clinicians need a way to predict these drug interactions. This problem is combinatorially difficult due to the massive number of drugs, variations in drug features such as molecular structure, and the range of potential interactions. By using neural networks, clinicians could uncover patterns in drug interaction, enabling better understanding of drug functionality on the body. This understanding could not only discover negative drug interactions, but also secondary use-cases of drugs for treatment.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional model architectures, such as proposed by $Rohani^{1}$ utilize drug-similarity matrices of features such as molecular substructure to predict interactions. These matrices are sub-selected for the most informative and fused into a singular matrix as input for a neural network. These approaches omit critical information about the kind of interactions between drugs, and simply discover any interaction. For clinicians to properly understand drug functionality and safety of use, they must be able to predict the severity and type of drug interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Graph Neural Networks have recently been employed to encode and explore various drug interaction types. By encoding drugs as nodes, and interaction types as edges, models can better understand how drugs interact with one another. However, generating graph representations of drug interactions is challenging, particularly in how to combine various features from various sources and how to generate embeddings. $Lin et al^{2}$, generates a graph structure from various features, but only predicts the presence of an interaction from node locality - ignoring the semantic representation of features.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Paper Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "$Al-Rabeah^{3}$ improves upon both the traditional and GNN approaches by utilizing graph networks of various features to generate embeddings for feeding into a neural network for classification. The aim is to integrate both the similarity matrices of previous approaches with GNN embeddings of multiple featuresets, in order to represent a heterogeneous network for predicting the types of drug-drug interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The work utilizes four feature matrices (Chemical structure, Target, Enzyme, and Pathway) as attributes for nodes representing drugs via similarity matrices, with edges being the drug-drug interaction. A graph is constructed for each feature matrix, and each graph is then used to generate an embedding matrix with a vector for each drug and interaction type. This is done via a random walk from the drug node utilizing edges of the given interaction type to form a node sequence, which is then used to learn embeddings. For each drug pair, the drug embedding vectors are element-wise multiplied with each other to represent drug-drug pairs. These vectors are then fed into the corresponding neural network, one for each graph, using a softmax to generate a probability vector over all event types. These probabilities are then averaged to produce a final prediction vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The work tested using all subsets of the feature matrices, with the best performance from using all four matrices gathered. The results, achieving 0.9206, 0.9992, 0.9717, 0.8579, and 0.8259 Accuracy, AUC, AUPR, F1, and recall scores respectively, outperformed many recent DDI works. This showed significant improvement over traditional Neural Network approaches, such as CNN-DDI by $Zhang^{4}$. While other GNN approaches, such as the novel KGNN, achieved better performance in some metrics such as F1 score - their analysis was over individual datasets and neglected several features. From this, the GNN-DDI architecture showed exceptional performance as it was faced with multiple-datasets, indicating strong usage across various features.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The work of $Al-Rabeah^{3}$ showed the strength of combining various feature sets for generating neural network inputs. Likewise, the paper exemplified the utility in combining multiple components of past approaches (GNN and fusion of multiple similarity matrix results) to produce a robust architecture performant over features from multiple datasets.\n",

        "# Scope of Reproducibility\n",
        "\n",
        "All of our efforts, including this notebook, pre-computed models, processed data, etc. are located within [our teams Github repository](https://github.com/NealRyan/Drug-drug-interaction-modeling/blob/main). For our project, we utilized the [papers authors code repository](https://github.com/Mohammad-Hussain95/GNN_DDI/tree/main/).\n",
        "\n",
        "The original code was written in Tensorflow and was extremely hard to understand and modify, using obscure, lengthy matrix transformations to perform general operations. We first re-implemented the entire code repository of the paper using PyTorch.  By re-writing in PyTorch, we found it easier to implement various modifications/ablations within the original codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Architecture Modifications\n",
        "\n",
        "Base on our best interpreations of the authors, we made several changes to the papers implementation to better fit the goal of predicting drug interactions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The similarity matrices used are a series of Jaccard similarity followed by PCA. We implemented PCA and use the PCA'd similarity matrices for generating our graph embeddings. The PCA step was omitted in both the paper and the original repository.\n",
        "* In the original work, the graph network for generating embeddings was trained on positive interactions and didn't account for a lack of interaction betwen drugs. As a result, the dense network is also only trained on positive examples. We assume this to be a flaw in the design, skewing model performance towards the most common interaction events. We opted to balance the dataset with positive and negative interactions for DNN training.\n",
        "* As a result of the above, we expanded our output vector from 65->66 to account for the non-interaction \"event\".\n",
        "* We opted to average the output metrics to account for our new non-interaction class and the severe class imbalance. Using a weighted average does bias the model somewhat given the low prevelance of some events.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Experiments / Hypothesis / Ablations\n",
        "\n",
        "We tested the following hypothesis, experiments, and ablations listed below. See the Results section for a summary of the testing experiments.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Hyperparameter Tuning.\n",
        "   By varying the below hyperparameters, we attempt to achieve a higher performance from the model. The paper performs minimal hyperparameter tuning, so we anticipate minor tuning to significantly improve performance. In addition, the original paper uses the Adam optimizer which is relatively fast to converge on local minima. By optimizing parameters, we could achieve a better minimum for training our models.\n",
        "   - Layer size\n",
        "       - Varying the sizes of intermediary layers can constrain the model's performance to fit to training data. By reducing intermediary layer size, we can have a looser bias to the training set. This could be used to lower dropout rate, enabling faster training without sacrificing model generalization.\n",
        "   - Number of dense layers\n",
        "       - The dataset utilized by the paper is unbalanced leading to underfitting. We anticipate increasing the number of dense layers (2) within the neural networks will result in a more biased model - which could better fit the intricacies of less prevalent drug-drug interactions.\n",
        "   - Dropout rate\n",
        "       - The paper uses a dropout rate of 0.3 to inject random noise and reduce bias. By modifying dropout rate, alongside changes to layer size, we anticipate the same model generalization with improved fitting to training data.\n",
        "2. Removing Dropout, and replacing with optimizer weight decay.\n",
        "   Dropout introduces randomness into the network, while weight decay promotes a balanced model by regulating heavy weights. We anticipate weight decay to more effectively account for relations in similarity matrices, particularly for interactions less present in the training set, leading to a higher CV score.\n",
        "3. Replacing the Adam optimizer with SGD.\n",
        "   The paper did not tune the parameters of the Adam optimizer, which likely led to convergence on a suboptimal minima. SGD is less likely to converge on these minima, and should result in better generalizability than untuned Adam.\n",
        "4. Removal of dropout layers.\n",
        "   The proposed GNN relies on two hidden-layer 0.3 rate dropout layers to prevent overfitting. We will test the removal of each hidden layer, as well as both layers. By removing these layers, we can evaluate how tightly model overfits to the similarity matrices.\n",
        "5. Removal of early stopping.\n",
        "   The code utilizes early stopping to prevent model overfitting if performance doesn’t improve in 10 epochs. We will remove this limitation, and attempt to overfit our network while retaining dropout. This will help evaluate how injected noise impacts performance.\n",
        "6. Combining of 4 feedforward networks into 1.\n",
        "   The paper uses 4 feedforward networks to evaluate each property type independently and aggregates the results, however this does not capture any interactions between property types. We will test concatenating the feature vectors from each property type and using a single feedforward network with this feature vector.\n",

The Pathway feature matrix also includes data from the KEGG database, also encoded in eventdb. Eventdb can be found at [this link as a SQLLiteDB](https://github.com/YifanDengWHU/DDIMDL/blob/master/event.db) and can be queried as a SQLLite database. In our preprocessing code below, we select all data from two tables within the eventdb: DRUG and INTERACTION. The DRUG table contains the 572 drugs and the attributes above (as | delineated strings). We use the DRUG table to derive the 4 matrices listed above. Each row in the matrices represents an individual drug, while the columns are 1-hot encodings of the presence of drug properties. As a result, each matrix varies in the length of the second axis.\n",

This results in uniform 572x572 similarity feature matrices. These similarity matrices were provided, however we also utilized our own code to derive these matrices. PCA analysis was then done on the similarity matrices, and the resulting matrices become the node attributes for our various graphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, the paper utilizes an interaction matrix, describing 65 types of interactions between the 572 drugs (as well as no interaction). This matrix is derived from the INTERACTION table of eventdb. These 65 (66 including no interaction) types are the types of DDI events extracted by $Deng et al^{5}$. This matrix is used to create the edges of our drug graphs.\n",

        "From this, the paper can derive two submatrices: the presence of drug interactions and interaction types. The distribution of the data is extremely uneven across event types, resulting in underfitting to the less represented events. This fact informed the basis of many of our experiments - as we try to appropriately fit the model for these events.\n",

The features of the nodes in the graph will be a row of the feature matrix, corresponding to that drug's similarity to each of the other drugs in the network on that property type (enzyme for instance).

This vector contains all the graph's embedded knowledge for ONE PARTICULAR drug.

        "We attribute our better results to our proper construction of the training and testing data, which now contain an even 50-50 split of positive and negative examples. The original code only trained the networks on positive samples, resulting in a skew towards predicting an interaction. This manifested in a lower Recall and F1 score. By training on both positive and negative samples, our models recognized when interactions DON'T occur, not just when they do.

        "As shown above, adjusting the size of the model by tuning layer size and number of layers had a negative impact on model performance across the board. Recall in our data exploration, we noted a skew in drug interaction events with some being exceedingly rare. While a more complex model would better model these niche cases, we overall lose performance compared to the majority of our dataset as our model fits these niche events tighter. This fits our hypothesis, where we speculated underfitting on niche fits, however we did not expect as large of a performance drop for the majority of events.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can observe changes in our models variance in our testing of dropout rates. A lower dropout rate (0.1) had negligible impact on our model, as we are already well generalized to the dataset due to our model's low complexity. A higher dropout rate (0.5) exacerbates this fact, making our model too generalized - thereby losing the modest fit to our training data.\n",

SGD is notably extremely sensitive to parameters, while Adam is overall extremely robust - leading to Adams popularity. Given more hyperparameter tuning, we could potentially outperform Adam/Dropout with a fine tuned SGD optimizer. Due to the computational expense of parameter tuning, this was not a viable avenue for us to explore.\n",

        "We tested two ablations: removal of dropout layers and removal of early stopping. Removal of dropout layers had a negative impact on performance. Since dropout is the only mechanism used by our model to inject noise, our model has little variance and a high bias to the training set. As such, it cannot generalize to new data as well.\n",

        "Removal of early stopping drastically increased computation time, taking ~10x the time to perform a trial. During training, our models optimized towards a local loss minima and stayed relatively constant. This indicates that the removal of early stopping had little impact on improving our performance - rather having a negative impact as we had less computation time to explore other tuning options.\n",
